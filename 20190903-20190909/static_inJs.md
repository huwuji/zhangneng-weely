js 中的static

引用：https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/understanding-static-in-javascript-10782149993

简介：理解1.js中当new多个class对象时，static 定义的属性不会被包含在new的对象中，而是会在class中被共享
 2.It is also important to note that proper static methods ARE NOT shared with the objects created by the class or function they are a member of, 
 unlike the static properties within React/ Babel transformed classes.
